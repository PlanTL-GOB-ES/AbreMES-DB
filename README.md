# SmaDB: Spanish Medical Abbreviation DataBase

## Introduction

This repository contains the Spanish Medical Abbreviation DataBase (SmaDB). This database is created after automatically detecting abbreviations and their potential definitions explicitly mentioned in the same sentence. These abbreviations are extracted from the titles and abstracts of different biomedical publications written in Spanish. The sources of these publications are SciELO[1], IBECS[2] and Pubmed[3]. We used a modified version of the algorithm developed by Schwartz & Hearst[4], adapted to the Spanish language and applying specific filters to improve its quality. 

To create this database, we use the metadata of different biomedical publications written in Spanish, which contain the titles and abstracts. The chosen schema is Dublin Core. We use the official ones from SciELO, and customized adaptations of the XML files to Dublin Core from IBECS and Pubmed metadata. These metadata are available at the MeSpEn website (http://temu.bsc.es/mespen). Learn more about Dublin Core in the following website: http://dublincore.org/

This database is based on the "Allie Search Service for Abbreviation / Long Form", developed by Yamamoto et al.[5], but contains Spanish abbreviations and their definitions instead of English ones. The structure of the database is inspired in this work.

This repository includes the latest version of the database, and the source code available. Users are permitted to change the code and adapt it to their needs without any restrictions, like adapting the abbreviation-definition extractor into other languages, domains, or other document types to analyze.


## Prerequisites

This software has been compiled with Java SE 1.8, and should work with recent versions. You can download Java from the following website: https://www.java.com/en/download

Stanford CoreNLP is needed as well. We used version 3.9.0 for this work, and latest versions should work as well. Stanford CoreNLP is licensed under the GNU General Public License (v3 or later). You can download it from the following website: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/

GeoNames is a geographical database which covers over eleven million placements. GeoNames is distributed under Creative Commons BY-4.0 license. It is available for download free or charge: http://www.geonames.org


## Directory structure

<pre>
exec/
The executable to create the database.

exec/SmaDB_lib/
Stanford CoreNLP module, necessary to get the abbreviations.

SmaDB/
The complete database available for everyone.

src/
Source code used to generate de database.

src/resources/
Files needed to execute the database creator:
  - corpora_list.txt: includes the folders where your corpora metadata are stored. The file needs 
  to have one corpus per line. For each line, use the following format: "corpus_name {TAB} corpus_folder". 
  Included corpora metadatas must follow the Dublin Core format.
  - geonames.zip: includes all the world location names extracted from GeoNames.
  - JST_spa.txt contains all Journal Subject Terms extracted from the Spanish edition of MeSH 
  (Medical Subject Headings). 
</pre>


## Usage

The executable file "SmaDB.jar" is the program you need to create your abbreviation-definition database. The executable needs one single parameter: the folder where the database will be stored. Before executing, you need to follow these simple steps:
* Create the output folder manually.
* Store inside that folder the files found at folder src/resources.

Remember that your corpora must be in Dublin Core format only. Learn more about Dublin Core in the following website: http://dublincore.org/

One your output directory is ready, just type the following command in your terminal:

<pre>
$ java -jar SmaDB.jar RESOURCES_DIRECTORY OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
</pre>


## Examples
<pre>
$ java -jar SmaDB.jar ~/SmaDB/resources ~/SmaDB/DB
</pre>
